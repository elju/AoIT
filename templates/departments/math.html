          Algebra
        </h3>
        <p class="dep-p">
          This course is designed to prepare students for the June 2014 Common Core Assessment as well as the New York State Integrated Algebra Regents Exam. Students will use algebraic, graphical and geometric reasoning to recognize patterns and structure through rich problem solving tasks. Students will also use mathematical methods to model and solve real-life applied problems involving money, data, chance, patterns, art, design and science. Within every unit, students will rely on their ability to reason and communicate effectively. The goal is for every student to receive a 80% or higher on either Exam, Regents or Common Core, in order to be successful in college.

          CUNY Math
        </h3>
        <p class="dep-p">
          The CUNY Math Assessment is critical in measuring your readiness for college success. This high-stakes test evaluates your competency in pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. The exam is un-timed, multiple choice, and computer based. It begins with algebra questions. Students must score a 40 or higher in order to pass. If you score below a 40 the test will then ask you pre-algebra questions. Within this section you must score a 45 or higher. If you pass the algebra section you will move on to questions pertaining to geometry and trig. Your results in this section will help the college decided which math class is most appropriate for your skill level. Your results on the CUNY Math Assessment can determine whether or not you can enroll in credit-bearing courses directly, or if you must first take non-credit course.

          Project Base Math
        </h3>
        <p class="dep-p">
          Project based math is a course offered at AoIT as a way for students to learn about how math impacts their daily lives. The course offers students a chance to practice basic math skills that they will need when handling daily activities. Students will also learn basic math of finance including simple interest, compound interest, basic banking, and tax preparation.To pass this course students need to come to class on a daily basis to avoid missing out on new formulas. The grading in the class is broken into projects, quizzes, and class work. There is no regents exam for this course, but students need knowledge of algebra.
